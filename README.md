# EFSim
EFSim: An Efficient and Flexible Simulation Framework for Digital In-Memory Computing

## sim_engine
This includes the IMC inference engine, customized hardware circuits, a hardware performance parameter library, performance simulation functions, and a customized workflow for specific workload.

## hw_part
This is a parameterized Chisel-based hardware library

## Setup
1. Verilator

    cd sim_engine

    make parallel_veri_sim       ** or **      make parallel_veri_sys
    


2. Chisel



This work is designed for fast, efficient and flexible simulation in IMC architecture.
